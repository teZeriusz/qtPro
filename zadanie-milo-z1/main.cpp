/*
An anagram derivation is a N-letter word derived from a N-1 letter word by adding a letter and
rearranging. For example, here is a derivation of "aliens":

    ail + s = sail + n = nails + e = aliens

Write a program that will find the longest such derivation from a specific 3-letter word (one word
provided by user) in a list of words where every derived word also exists in the list of words.
words = {ail, tennis, nails, desk, aliens, table, engine, sail, etc....}

Requirements:
• fully working application
• documentation of used algorithm (can be in a form of comments in code)
• application should be able to operate on external dictionary - text file where each line is
another word
